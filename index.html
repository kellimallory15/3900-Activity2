            <p>

                My name is Kelli Smith. I am a 22-year-old girl from Bellevue, Nebraska.
                I have lived in Nebraska my entire life. I am the last of four children to my parents Kevin and Vicky Smith.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am a student at the University of Nebraska Omaha.
                I am a double-major student, studying Management Information Systems and Business Administration, with concentrations in Marketing, Management, Supply Chain Management, and Human Resources.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am a business owner. I own and run my own photography business, Kelli Mallory Photography. I primarily photograph high school and college seniors, couples, and families.
                In addition to this, I maintain the website, social media, and all the communications. With this job, I am busy all year round, but a majority of my photoshoots take place from May to November.
                I love my job because I love meeting and working with lots of people.

            </p>

            <p>
              Outside of school and work, I have a few other passions.
              My first is taking care of animals.
              I own four cats named Sabyr, Symba, Sunny, and Tallulah.
              I also own an axolotl named Jesseppee.
              I am a huge animal lover, so spending time with them is my favorite thing to do.

            <p>
              In addition to this, I love to travel.
              I have been to 15 different countries, with my top three favorites being Austria, Switzerland, and Croatia.
              I hope to visit 20 countries in total by the time I am 30.
